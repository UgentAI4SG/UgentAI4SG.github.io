<!-- h3>Passionate about academic research to affect people's lives for the better. Currently leading two <a class="smoothscroll" href="#staff">research teams</a> as a professor at Ghent University, Belgium: One on <span>information retrieval and extraction</span> (mostly discovering information from unstructured text documents), one on <span>smart grids</span> (using advanced algorithms to steer electricity consumption, and data analytics to discover people’s consumption patterns and the flexibility therein). I'm also still collaborating with other researchers on (optical) networking, mainly dimensioning studies.</h3>
     <h3>Further, I’m also a trained snowboard instructor (to teach beginners), but that's not really what this page is about. Nor does it cover some graphic design I do in my spare time. It also doesn't illustrate my love of playing sports (badminton, indoor soccer, mountain biking), music, theatre or the occasional comedy show. Well, actually, I guess it does now. Sort of.</h3>
