            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>The Artificial Intelligence for Smart Grids (AI4SG) team conducts research on smart grids, ranging from reinforcement learning  based demand response to deep learning based models. A central theme of our research is the development of creative new algorithms for effective control of flexible assets in the grid, both in residential and industrial segments of the smart grid. Our research usually is closely linked/aligned with industry partners through collaborative projects.</p>

            <p>Smart grids are the next step in the evolution of power grids, characterized by the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and a distributed network of prosumers. The transition of the power grid to a truly smart grid requires managing the ever more challenging demand-supply balance, given the presence of a rising RES fraction in generation, as well as increased electrification on the demand side (e.g., electric vehicle charging). This calls for grid health monitoring to ensure reliable operation and/or reduce our CO2 footprint. Artificial intelligence and machine learning facilitate this transition by developing predictive models and control systems (e.g., models trained on data collected from EV charging stations, solar farms, etc.). Some of the AI topics we recently have been working on include: reinforcement learning (e.g., DQN, DDQN, DDPG), physics informed neural networks, deep learning, graph neural networks inspired RL, etc. We use such methods to address: demand response for EV charging, flexibility identification and control in industrial processes, anomaly detection in solar panels, load profile clustering, etc.</p>
