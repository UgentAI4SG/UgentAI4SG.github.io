            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>The Artificial Intelligence for Smart Grids Group (AI4SG) conducts research for smart grids (SG), ranging from reinforcement learning  based demand response to deep learning based models. A central theme of our research is the development of creative new algorithms for designing effective control for industrial, residential and other in segments of the smart grid, with a link to industry through collaborative projects.</p>

            <p>Smart girds are the next step in the evolution of power grids, characterized by integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and distributed network of prosumers. Transition of power grids to smart grids requires management of demand-supply and grid health monitoring to ensure reliable operation and reduce CO2 footprint. Artificial intelligence and machine learning facilitate this transition by developing predictive models and control systems (e.g., models trained on data collected from EV charging stations, solar farms, etc.). Some of the AI areas we recently have been working on include: reinforcement learning (e.g., DQN, DDQN, DDPG), physics informed neural networks, deep learning, graph neural networks inspired RL, etc. We have used these methods to address: demand response for EV charging, flexibility identification in industrial process, anomaly detection in solar panels, control design for industrial processes, load profile clustering in and monitoring, etc.</p>
